## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
During our anaylsis of Kickstarter fundraiser campaigns we took a closer look at the number of campaigns that were considered successful, failed and canceled per each's fundraiser goal.  We filtered the data to include only theater fundraisers.  We then sorted the data to take a look at the outcomes of each theater fundraiser based on launch month to determine the most successful launch month(s). No difficulties occured within our analysis. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
During our anaylsis of Kickstarter fundraiser campaigns we took a closer look at the number of campaigns that were considered successful, failed and canceled per each's fundraiser goal.  We filtered the data to include only theater fundraisers.  We then sorted the data to take a look at the outcomes of each theater fundraiser based on goal amount set for each fundraiser per various ranges. No difficulties occured within our analysis.

The highest number of successful theater fundraiser campaigns were launched in May, closely followed by June. October appears to be a notably unsuccessful month, as the number successful and failed are very close in range (succesful 65, failed 50).

Theater fundraiser campaign goals between less than $1,000 were the most successful.  More or less intuitively, the lower the fundraising goal amount, the more likely it is to be "successful."

Potential shortcomings may arise in our analysis of Outcomes vs Launch because the graph does not include years.  This may bear some weight on the fundraiser outcomes if there was a particularly good or bad year for any given month.  Potential shortcomings may also arise because the data is displayed in number of fundraisers considered successful, failed or canceled for each month, and not as a percentage successful, failed ot canceled per total number of fundraisers launched within each month.  It may be helpful to analyze futher and create a line graph dispalying such trend.

Potential shortcomings may also arise in our analysis of Outcomes vs Goals due to the cutoff range of greater than $50,000.  There is a large amount of fundraisers over $50,000 goal and could potentially be explored further.
